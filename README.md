# Little Man Computer
## A LMC implementation in Java


The Little Man Computer (LMC) is an instructional model of a computer, created by Dr. Stuart Madnick in 1965. It models the architecture of a simple computer and has all the basic features. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer for more information.

The original concept was that inside the CPU is a tiny man who runs around executing instructions encoded in a list. Inside the CPU there are:

- 100 Memory locations (numbered 0 to 99).
- An Arithmetic Unit to do calculations.
- An Accumulator to store the result of the last operation or calculation.
- A Program Counter to store the address (in memory) of the next instruction to do.
- An Instruction Register to hold the top digit of the instruction read from memory.
- An Address Register to hold the bottom two digits of the instruction read from memory.
- An Input tray into which a number can be typed when needed.
- An Output area where any numbers output are printed.
